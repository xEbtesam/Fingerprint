# Fingerprint
# Simple Fingerprint Orientation code
The goal of this project is to estimate the orientation field of a fingerprint. There are various methods to estimate the orientation filed. However, gradient-based methods assure more accuracy due to the limited number of fixed possible orientations. In this project, I used a very common gradient-based operator called Sobel Operator. It separates the y and x directions. It emphasizes sharp edges,lines, and details. Particulary, it will amplify noise.
